Although this calculator was functional, it wasn't very efficient, so the challenge was to create a better functioning calculator. The end result is a calculator that creates calculations by storing the properties of the previous value, current value and operator values using the React state hook. The logic flow was co-ordinated using a logic flow diagram, and then executed.",

The background color changes based on the temperature, which is determined by a ternary if/else statement. The app also displays weather information using an icon, temperature, location, and weather description. The use of React state and useEffect hooks enabled me to efficiently manage the app's state and call the API.",
